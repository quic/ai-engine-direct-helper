"""Chat-side feature SKILL.md content provider (Batch D / D-1).

Bridges the on-disk ``features/<dir>/SKILL.md`` files into the
``RichSystemPromptBuilder`` so that when the user activates a
toolbar feature mode (``model-build`` / ``ppt`` / ``code`` / ...),
the corresponding SKILL.md content is injected into the system
prompt's feature-prompt section.

V1 parity
---------
Mirrors V1 ``FeatureManager.get_feature_prompt``:

* ``TOOL_MODE_DIR_MAP`` translates the frontend ``activeToolMode``
  value (e.g. ``"model-build"``) to the ``features/`` subdirectory
  name (``"model-builder"``).
* ``get_feature_prompt(tool_mode)`` reads ``features/<dir>/SKILL.md``
  fresh each call (V1 hot-reload semantics — edit the file, next
  request sees the change with no server restart).
* Missing / unmapped / unreadable ⇒ returns ``None``.

Encoding
--------
SKILL.md files contain Chinese + Markdown.  Per AGENTS.md §3.10
(file encoding fastener) we always read with
``open(p, encoding="utf-8")``.  Encoding errors are logged and the
provider returns ``None`` rather than crashing the prompt build.

Caching
-------
Following the v1 ``feature_manager.py`` no-cache semantics we
re-read the file on every call.  A typical SKILL.md is ~70 KB
(``features/model-builder/SKILL.md`` = 70 038 bytes) and chat
turns are user-paced, so the cost is acceptable.  If profiling
ever flags it, a (path, mtime)-keyed lru_cache can be slotted in
without changing the public callable signature.

Architecture
------------
This module lives in ``apps/api/`` because it composes:

* the ``features/`` directory layout (a platform-level concept —
  installed alongside the app), and
* the ``qai.chat`` ``SystemPromptBuilderPort`` (a chat-context
  abstraction).

``qai.chat`` cannot reach into ``features/`` directly; the
provider is exposed as a plain ``Callable[[str], str | None]``
that ``RichSystemPromptBuilder`` accepts via constructor
injection.  This keeps the chat domain free of filesystem
coupling.

class FeatureSkillProvider:
    """Callable that returns the SKILL.md body for a ``tool_mode``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features_dir:
        Absolute path to the chat-feature skill directory.  Typically
        ``<repo_root>/factory/chat_features``.
    workspace_root:
        The configured model-builder workspace root (e.g. ``C:/WoS_AI``
        or a user override). The on-disk SKILL.md / references use the
        ``${WORKSPACE}`` placeholder; this gate substitutes it with the
        actual configured path before the body reaches the system prompt
        so the agent is instructed to write artifacts under the *real*
        workspace (not the literal token, and not the repo root). When
        ``None`` the placeholder is left verbatim (defensive — the agent
        still sees a clearly-templated token rather than a wrong path).
    app_root:
        Absolute application install root (repo root). Substituted for the
        ``${APP_ROOT}`` placeholder so the agent invokes the bundled
        model-builder scripts (under ``factory/chat_features/...``) by
        ABSOLUTE path — the tool CWD is the workspace, not the repo root,
        so a bare relative ``factory\\...`` path would not resolve. When
        ``None`` it is inferred from ``features_dir`` (its parent's parent,
        i.e. ``<repo_root>/factory/chat_features`` → ``<repo_root>``).
    tool_mode_dir_map:
        Optional override of the tool_mode → subdir mapping.
        Defaults to :data:`TOOL_MODE_DIR_MAP`.
