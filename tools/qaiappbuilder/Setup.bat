REM --- Argument parsing -------------------------------------------------------
REM DEFAULT INSTALL = fast base runtime only: Python venv + dependencies +
REM pre-built-model inference. Heavy optional components are OPT-IN:
REM   --builder       : QAIRT model-builder env (Step 8: ~2GB SDK download + x64
REM                     converter venv + VS build tools). Needed only to CONVERT
REM                     models; pre-built models run without it.
REM   --voice-models  : pre-download Whisper / Zipformer / MeloTTS weights (Step
REM                     7b). Otherwise fetched on first use by the runtime
REM                     (weight_downloader.py).
REM   --git           : PortableGit (Step 5). Only needed for exec shell='sh'.
REM   --frontend      : portable Node.js + pnpm (Step 5b). Only needed for Build.bat.
REM   --full          : all of the above (the old default on arm64).
REM   --desktop       : Rust + tauri-cli (Step 9). Implies --builder (the MSVC C++
REM                     tools from Step 8.3 are required to compile tauri-cli).
REM   --no-builder    : kept for compatibility; the builder is already OFF by
REM                     default. An explicit --no-builder wins over the
REM                     implication of --desktop / --full.
REM   --no-pause      : do not pause at the end (for non-interactive / scripted runs).
REM This script merges the former V1 Setup_Builder_Env.bat in full (Step 8);
REM everything runs in-process via scripts\setup\setup_qairt_env.py and
REM scripts\setup\install_vs.ps1 - it does NOT depend on the qai.exe CLI.
REM   --dev        : also install the dev + e2e extras (pytest / mypy / ruff /
REM                  pre-commit / import-linter / pytest-playwright). These are
REM                  for CONTRIBUTORS running the test suite only; a normal
REM                  end-user install does NOT need them. Default OFF. NOTE:
REM                  Playwright + the ~150MB Chromium browser are now installed
REM                  by DEFAULT (the ``search`` runtime extra + Step 4d), because
REM                  the web-search browser engine needs them at runtime.
REM NO_BUILDER is left unset here (not 0/1) so an explicit --builder /
REM --no-builder can be told apart from "no flag passed"; the default (1, or 0
REM when --desktop / --full implies it) is applied right after argument parsing.

REM      launchers (Start.bat / qai.bat / Console.bat) agree on the arch
REM      without re-probing PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE (which lies under Prism).
REM   3. Auto-detect via %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% / %PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432%.
REM      Snapdragon/WoS hosts report ARM64; native x64 hosts report AMD64
REM      (or, when a 32-bit shell runs on 64-bit Windows, ARCHITEW6432=AMD64).
REM Two independent `if` lines (not else) so the WOW64 var can override.

REM is the only download that CANNOT use that wrapper's aria2c path -- it
REM has to come down via the PowerShell single-thread fallback.
REM Even so, we route it through the SAME wrapper so:
REM   1) the PS fallback gets retry + size-check protection,

REM published as a single downloadable archive and merged into vendor\ here,
REM BEFORE Step 4a installs the ARM64-only wheels from vendor\whl\.
REM
REM Idempotent: if all four dirs already exist (dev checkout, or a prior run),
REM the download is skipped. Non-fatal: a failure only warns; if vendor\whl\
REM ends up missing, Step 4a is skipped and uv falls back to PyPI.
call :fetch_vendor_deps

REM --- Step 0c: Download guard64.dll (native file-guard DLL, ARM64 + x64) ---
REM
REM guard64.dll is NOT shipped in the repository (binary artifact, excluded from
REM source control). It is published as guard.zip on the GitHub release page and
REM must be downloaded and extracted into vendor\bin\{arm64,x64}\ AFTER the
REM vendor-deps bundle (Step 0b) has been merged, so that vendor\bin\ already
REM exists and the DLL lands in the correct location.
REM
REM Idempotent: skipped when both DLLs are already present (dev checkout or
REM prior run). Non-fatal: a failure only warns; the app still starts but the
REM native file-guard hook will be inactive.
call :fetch_guard_dlls

REM --- Step 0d: Download the ast-grep CLI (structural search / rewrite) ------
REM
REM Runs AFTER Step 0c on purpose: that step creates vendor\bin\{arm64,x64}\
REM and proves the download helper works, so this one lands its executable in a
REM directory that already exists rather than racing to create it.
REM
REM ast-grep backs the ``ast_grep`` / ``ast_edit`` agent tools. Installs the
REM HOST_ARCH build only (one machine runs one Python 3.13 arch). Idempotent
REM (skipped when the executable is present) and non-fatal (a failure only
REM warns; those two tools then report a clear "not installed" error).

REM --- Step 1: Download uv if not present ---
REM
REM Goes through download_with_aria2c.ps1 which: tries aria2c first (when

REM PowerShell otherwise. Both paths get retry + stall-watchdog + size+zip

REM interpreter path when present; only then do we avoid the slower
REM ``uv python install`` round-trip (which is itself idempotent but prints
REM "already installed" and re-resolves every run).

REM --- Step 2b: Ensure the Visual C++ runtime the managed CPython needs -------
REM uv's managed CPython (python-build-standalone) dynamically links the MSVC
REM runtime (vcruntime140.dll / vcruntime140_1.dll / msvcp140.dll). On a CLEAN

REM so a run that was interrupted after fastapi but before the rest
REM (structlog, claude_agent_sdk, ...) would leave a HALF-installed venv that
REM still passed ``import fastapi`` -- and the skip below then made that
REM broken state permanent (Setup printed SUCCESS but Start.bat crashed with
REM ``No module named 'structlog'``).
REM
REM Fix: require the WHOLE dependency closure to import -- NOT ``qai`` itself
REM (the app source is never installed into this venv; it is loaded via
REM PYTHONPATH from %ROOT_DIR%src, see above) -- and ``structlog`` (a
REM late-installed runtime dep). If ANY is missing we do NOT skip; we fall
REM
REM ``claude_agent_sdk`` is included in the probe too: Step 4a installs its
REM vendored wheel with ``--no-deps`` and Step 4b2 resolves its ``mcp`` (and
REM sub-deps) via the ``[cc-sdk]`` extra. A venv left by an OLDER Setup.bat that
REM installed the SDK wheel but never pulled ``mcp`` imports ``fastapi/.../qai``
REM fine yet fails ``import claude_agent_sdk`` (``No module named 'mcp'``) and
REM degrades the CC backend to pure-HTTP. Probing it here makes such a venv
REM fall through to the (idempotent) install so the missing ``mcp`` is healed.
REM
REM ``croniter`` is probed for the same self-heal reason: it is a runtime dep
REM (pyproject [project].dependencies) added with the scheduled-task feature,
REM backing the cron-expression schedule kind of the ``scheduled_task`` tool.
REM A venv left by an OLDER Setup.bat has fastapi/.../qai but NOT croniter;
REM listing it here makes that venv fall through to the idempotent Step 4b2
REM install so uv pulls croniter from PyPI (pure-Python py3-none-any wheel, no
REM vendored wheel needed) instead of the [SKIP] branch stranding it absent.
REM ``playwright`` is probed for the same self-heal reason: it is a DEFAULT
REM runtime extra (``[search]``, Step 4b2) required by BOTH the ``web`` search
REM browser engine AND the interactive ``browser`` agent tool. A venv left by
REM an OLDER Setup.bat (core packages present, playwright absent) would
REM otherwise take the [SKIP] branch and NEVER install playwright + its
REM Chromium binary (Step 4d), stranding the browser tool disabled. Probing it
REM here forces fall-through to the idempotent Step 4b2 (``.[search]``) + Step
REM 4d (``playwright install chromium``) so both self-heal. ``selectolax`` and
REM ``lxml`` are probed for the SAME self-heal reason: they back the keyless
REM HTML search engines (baidu/bing/mojeek) — WITHOUT a parser those three
REM engines all fail with "no HTML parser available" (only the browser engine
REM survives). Both ship prebuilt ARM64 cp313 wheels on PyPI, so probing them
REM does not force an sdist rebuild; a venv left by an OLDER Setup.bat missing
REM them falls through to the idempotent Step 4b2 ``.[search]`` install.
REM ``browserforge`` is probed for the same reason: it generates the dynamic
REM per-request browser fingerprint the keyless scrapers use to evade bot
REM detection (import-guarded, so its absence only drops back to a static
REM header set), and ships a pure-Python wheel so probing it forces no rebuild.

REM --- Step 4a: Pre-install ARM64-only wheels from vendor\whl\ ---
REM
REM TODO(release vendor bootstrap): In release artifacts the `vendor/` tree is
REM   NOT shipped (manifest.toml [exclude] vendor/). The plan is to package
REM   vendor/ as a separate downloadable archive and, on install, fetch +
REM   extract it BEFORE this step so `%WHL_DIR%` exists on the end-user box.
REM   That download/extract bootstrap is not implemented yet; until it lands,
REM   this step is skipped when `%WHL_DIR%` is absent (see the guard below),
REM   and on dev machines it uses the in-repo vendor/whl/ directly.
REM
REM These wheels are NOT available on PyPI for win_arm64 cp313 (or have
REM been revoked); pip would otherwise fall back to building them from
REM sdist (and fail because the dev box has no native toolchain).
REM
REM ``--no-deps`` is critical: a couple of these wheels declare
REM transitive dependencies that PyPI only ships as sdist on ARM64
REM (e.g. claude-agent-sdk -> mcp -> pyjwt[crypto] -> cryptography sdist
REM for newer versions).  We just want the wheel file unpacked into the
REM venv; the proper resolution of all transitives happens in step 4b2.
REM
REM IMPORTANT: vendor\whl\ files are precious - three wheels
REM (aiohttp 3.13.5 / cryptography 45.0.5 / MarkupSafe 2.1.5) have been
REM revoked from PyPI for cp313 ARM64 and the local copies are the only
REM source.  Do NOT delete files from vendor\whl\.  See vendor\whl\README.md.
REM x64 has no vendored wheels: skip Step 4a wholesale and let uv resolve most
REM dependencies from PyPI in Step 4b2 (aiohttp/cryptography/MarkupSafe all ship
REM x64 cp313 wheels on PyPI). qai_appbuilder is NOT on PyPI -- it is downloaded
REM from GitHub releases and installed separately after :skip_all_installs (see

REM [project].dependencies and installs all third-party runtime dependencies
REM into the SHARED venv. It deliberately does NOT install the local
REM ``qaimodelbuilder``/``qai`` package itself (no ``-e .`` / ``.``), and so
REM registers no console-script entry points (qai / qai-serve /
REM qai-uninstall) -- the shared venv is used by every installation on this
REM machine, so binding it to one project's source tree would make every
REM OTHER installation load the wrong code. Instead, every launcher
REM (Start.bat / qai.bat / Console.bat) sets PYTHONPATH to ITS OWN
REM %ROOT_DIR%src before invoking ``python -m apps.cli`` /
REM ``apps.cli.serve`` / ``scripts.init.uninstall`` directly, so each
REM installation always resolves its own source regardless of which project
REM last ran Setup.bat in this venv.
REM
REM The ``[cc-sdk]`` extra is included so the Claude Code SDK backend
REM (``claude_agent_sdk``, V1 file checkpoint/rewind parity) is actually
REM USABLE: Step 4a pre-installs the vendored ARM64 ``claude_agent_sdk`` wheel
REM with ``--no-deps``, which deliberately skips its transitive dependencies
REM (chiefly ``mcp``). Without this extra, ``import claude_agent_sdk`` fails at
REM ``from mcp.types import ToolAnnotations`` with ``No module named 'mcp'`` and
REM the CC backend silently degrades to the pure-HTTP adapter. Resolving the
REM ``[cc-sdk]`` extra here pulls ``mcp`` (and its sub-deps: httpx-sse /
REM jsonschema / pyjwt / pywin32 / sse-starlette / rpds-py, all wheels on PyPI
REM / vendor\whl) so the SDK imports cleanly. ``claude_agent_sdk`` itself stays

REM --- Step 4f: Initialize the runtime data/ tree (install pipeline) ---
REM
REM AGENTS.md project-level rule (2026-06-19): a freshly-installed package
REM ships WITHOUT a data/ directory; Setup.bat is the user-facing install
REM entry point and MUST initialise data/ to "ready-to-use" state. The
REM install pipeline (scripts.init.install) is the project's purpose-built
REM mechanism for "blank -> complete data/" — idempotent, stage-based, with
REM dry-run/verify modes. Setup MUST drive it (do NOT hand-roll SQL or seed
REM logic here).
REM
REM Stages run (4 of 5 — compile_factory is skipped):
REM   data_dir         create data/db/qai.db + schema migrations + dirs
REM   seed_defaults    INSERT factory/db_staging/*.jsonl into kv_user_prefs +
REM                    model_catalog_entry (cloud-gateway provider, default
REM                    selected model, toolbar prefs, etc.)
REM   secret_bootstrap register SecretStore namespaces (empty placeholders)
REM   edition_secrets  internal-only: provision factory cloud-provider API
REM                    keys (e.g. cloud LLM service) into the SecretStore. No-op
REM                    on external editions (gated by Settings.is_internal).
REM
REM compile_factory is SKIPPED because user-machine release packages do NOT
REM ship factory/_source/; the pre-built factory/db_staging/*.jsonl seeds
REM are bundled directly. compile_factory would auto-skip on missing source
REM anyway, but the explicit --skip keeps the stage log free of confusing
REM "skipped: no source" notes.
REM
REM Position: AFTER ``:skip_all_installs`` so that a fast re-run (where the
REM dep closure check at Step 4 hits the [SKIP] branch and jumps straight
REM here) STILL runs the install pipeline. The pipeline itself is fully
REM idempotent — every stage short-circuits on already-applied state
REM (kv_user_prefs uses INSERT OR IGNORE; secret_bootstrap.exists() guards
REM the write so user-set credentials are NEVER clobbered back to "";
REM edition_secrets refuses to overwrite a non-empty user value) — so a
REM second pass costs only stat-level checks (~1-2s).
REM
REM Failure handling: a seed failure must NOT block Setup. By this point
REM venv + Python deps are fully installed; the user can still launch the
REM UI, manually populate provider configs, and re-run install later. We
REM log [WARN] (matching the PortableGit / TTS-predeploy patterns above)

REM archives (whisper_medium / zipformer / melotts_zh, all v0.55.0) from

REM aria2c (multi-thread + resume) when available, or PowerShell as fallback,
REM then extracted with our bundled 7zr.exe.
REM
REM Hard-constraint (2): missing weights NEVER crash the app. The runner-side
REM auto-download (factory\chat_features\app-builder\shared\weight_downloader.py) covers the
REM "first inference on a fresh machine" case at runtime; this step only
REM warms the cache so the first inference is fast. Any failure here is
REM logged as [WARN] and Setup proceeds (overall exit 0).

REM runtime downloads them on first use anyway, so skipping keeps Setup fast.

REM  Subroutine: download the ast-grep CLI binary (Step 0d)
REM ===========================================================================
REM ``ast-grep`` backs the ``ast_grep`` (structural search) and ``ast_edit``
REM (structural rewrite) agent tools. Those match on the SYNTAX TREE, so they
REM skip a name that only appears in a comment or a string literal, and they
REM still match a call wrapped across several lines -- both are blind spots of
REM the regex-based ``grep`` tool, which is why this is a real dependency and
REM not more regex.
REM
REM Why a prebuilt binary and not a Python package: ``ast-grep-py`` publishes NO
REM win_arm64 wheel, so pip would fall back to building the Rust extension from
REM source on this host. Upstream ships per-arch CLI binaries instead, which is
REM the same way ripgrep is already consumed here.
REM
REM Only the HOST_ARCH build is fetched: a machine runs ONE Python 3.13 arch
REM (arm64 host -> arm64 interpreter, x64 host -> x64 interpreter), so the other
REM arch's 51 MB executable would never run. Keyed off HOST_ARCH exactly like
REM PY_SPEC / VENV_DIR_NAME / VCREDIST_ARCH.
REM
REM Runs after Step 0c, so vendor\bin\<arch>\ already exists.
REM Idempotent: skipped when the executable is present. Non-fatal: a failure
REM only warns, and the two AST tools then report a clear "binary not installed"
REM error rather than silently returning "no matches" -- a silent empty result
REM would read as "nothing to fix", which is the dangerous failure here.

echo.
echo      --frontend     Install portable Node.js + pnpm ^(Step 5b^). Only needed

echo.
echo      --full         Everything above ^(--builder --voice-models --git

echo.
echo      --no-builder   Compatibility flag: the builder is already off by
echo                     default. Wins over the implication of --full/--desktop.
echo.
echo      --dev          Also install the developer / test toolchain:

REM   2) MSVC C++ toolchain + Win SDK  -- installed by Step 8.3 (install_vs.ps1);
REM                                       REQUIRED to compile native crates like
REM                                       `ring` (assert.h / cl.exe / link.exe).
REM   3) `cargo tauri` subcommand      -- tauri-cli, via `cargo install --locked`
REM   (4) WebView2 runtime             -- preinstalled on Win11; Win10 handled by
REM                                       the Tauri bundle installer at runtime.
REM
REM This runs AFTER Step 8 so (2) exists. We then load the VS build environment
REM (vcvars / VsDevCmd) so cargo's cc-rs build scripts see INCLUDE / LIB / cl.exe
REM -- the earlier ordering (Step 5c before Step 8) is exactly why the previous
REM run died with "fatal error: 'assert.h' file not found" while building `ring`.
REM
REM Cost: rustup minimal toolchain ~600 MB; tauri-cli compile ~300 MB + 5-10 min
REM on ARM64. OPT-IN: skipped unless Setup.bat --desktop was passed.

REM First, check if the system WebView2 Evergreen Runtime is properly registered
REM and usable. If it is, we don't need our own Fixed Version copy (~811 MB).
REM
REM Detection method: check the registry key that WebView2's
REM GetAvailableCoreWebView2BrowserVersionString() API reads. This is the same
REM mechanism Tauri/wry uses internally to locate the runtime. If the key exists
REM and points to a valid directory with msedgewebview2.exe, the system runtime
REM is functional and we skip the install entirely.
REM
REM The registry key lives at:
REM   HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Clients\{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BEB-13D6E2756B32}  (pv = version)

REM
REM Rationale (user 2026-06-20, extended 2026-06-22):
REM   * The model (agent) may EDIT launcher scripts -- so they need a fast
REM     file-level restore source.
REM   * qnn-context-binary-generator.exe is easily corrupted by accidental
REM     output redirection (CWD landing inside SDK, relative-path > redirect).
REM     Keeping a ~4 MB backup avoids a ~2 GB SDK reinstall.
REM   * Other binaries (.dll/.so/.cat) and lib\python are NOT backed up here --
REM     those are repaired from the kept zip instead.
REM Backup target: data\sdk\qairt-scripts\<arch>\<name> (OUTSIDE C:\Qualcomm).

REM  Subroutine: try one 7za.exe extraction attempt for the QAIRT SDK zip.
REM  Args: %1 = attempt number (used in the log line only).
REM  Reads:  %QAIRT_SEVEN_ZIP%      (path to data\bin\7zr\7za.exe)
REM          %QAIRT_VENDOR_ZIP%     (path to the QAIRT zip on disk)
REM          %QAIRT_EXTRACT_TMP%    (temp extraction dir)
REM  Writes: %QAIRT_EXTRACT_OK%=1 on success (left at 0 on failure).
REM
REM  Behaviour: wipes %QAIRT_EXTRACT_TMP% first (so a prior partial extract
REM  cannot leave stale files), then runs:
REM      7za.exe x -y -o<tmp> <zip> -bso1 -bsp1 -bse2
REM  -bsp1 is the key flag -- it streams a LIVE progress line to stdout
REM  (percentage + current file), so the user sees concrete activity instead
REM  of a frozen-looking screen. ``-bso1`` keeps the per-file log line on
REM  stdout, ``-bse2`` keeps real errors on stderr.
REM
REM  Implementation note: we use ``goto :qairt_try_7za_fail`` (not an
REM  ``if errorlevel 1 ( ... %errorlevel% ... )`` parens block) to bail out,
REM  because cmd.exe expands %errorlevel% at block-entry time (giving stale

REM      handles .7z archives only and rejects .zip input with
REM      "Cannot open the file as archive" (exit 2). Sufficient for
REM      PortableGit (a 7z-format SFX) and vendor-deps.7z, but NOT for
REM      the QAIRT SDK .zip.
REM    * 7za.exe is the FULL standalone console build (~1 MB) shipped in
REM      7-Zip's "Extra" package (a .7z file). Console-only, NO installer,
REM      NO GUI -- it's just a single .exe you run from the command line.
REM      Supports zip / 7z / tar / gz / bz2 / xz / wim / iso / cab / etc.

REM  Source: https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2301-extra.7z (7-Zip 23.01 Extra,
REM  the long-stable 2023 release; URL is permanent on 7-zip.org). The
REM  archive is ~530 KB. We pin to 23.01 instead of the latest "26.01" so
REM  the URL never changes when 7-Zip releases a new version.
REM
REM  Strategy: download once into data\downloads\_7za_extra.7z, extract
REM  with our existing data\bin\7zr\7zr.exe (which CAN open .7z), copy
REM  7za.exe out of the extracted tree into data\bin\7zr\7za.exe, then
REM  delete the temp archive + extract dir. Idempotent: if 7za.exe is
REM  already present this is a no-op.
REM
REM  Best-effort: a failure leaves QAIRT_SEVEN_ZIP pointing at a missing
REM  file, which the caller's ``if not exist ... goto :qairt_extract_psh``
REM  uses to fall back to Expand-Archive. Setup is never aborted here.
