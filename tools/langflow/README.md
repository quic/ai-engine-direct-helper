## Introduction 
**Langflow** is a low-code development tool designed to simplify the creation and deployment of AI models. The **Langflow package** serves as a reference example, demonstrating how to run Langflow on PCs powered by Snapdragon® X. This package leverages the NPU (Neural Processing Unit) on Snapdragon® X to accelerate AI model inference.

The **Langflow** package includes 3 distinct flows:

1. **YoloV8_det Demo** – An object detection flow based on the YOLOv8 model.
2. **Image Classification Inceptionv3** – An image classification flow using the InceptionV3 model.
3. **Basic Chat Genie** – A conversational flow powered by a locally deployed large language model (LLM).

## ⚠️ Prerequisites


1. **PCs Powered by Snapdragon® X**: Ensure you have a PC powered by Snapdragon® X. For more information on compatible devices, visit [this page](https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragon/laptops)
2. **PowerShell 7**: Make sure PowerShell 7 is installed on your system.


## 🛠️ Installation Steps 

### 1. Install PowerShell 7  
**Most of the current systems come with PowerShell 5 by default. However, there are numerous download and installation operations in the setup that rely on the unique strategies of PowerShell 7. Therefore, PowerShell 7 must be installed to support it.**

Download and install the appropriate version of PowerShell 7 for your system:  
- [PowerShell 7.5.1 for ARM64](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.5.1/PowerShell-7.5.1-win-arm64.msi) 


### 2.  Quick Installation
For a quick installation of the langflow environment, please refer to: [launcher-README.md](https://github.com/quic/ai-engine-direct-helper/blob/main/tools/launcher/README.md)

## Using the Flows  

1. On the newly opened LangFlow web page, click the **"New flow"** button to enter the Templates interface.  
2. In the Templates window, click the **"Blank Flow"** button (bottom-right corner) to create a new blank flow.  
3. In the top navigation bar, select **"My Projects"** to access your project directory.  
4. In the left sidebar under **"Folders"**, locate and click the **"Upload a Flow"** icon (usually a folder with an arrow). This will open a file selection dialog.  
5. All flow files are located in the `tools\langflow\flows` directory. Select the desired flow file and click **"Open"** to upload it to your projects.  

### First-Time Setup
1. **Click the “+New Flow” Button**  
   On the main dashboard, click the **`+New Flow`** button to create a new flow.

2. **Select “+Blank Flow”**  
   In the pop-up **Get Started** window, scroll to the bottom-right corner and click **`+Blank Flow`** to start with an empty canvas.

3. **Enter the Flow Design Page**  
   You will be taken to the flow design interface. In the center of the screen, click the **`My Projects`** link to open the project manager.

4. **Upload Flow Templates**  
   In the project manager, click the **upload icon** next to the **Folders** section.

5. **Import Flow Files**  
   Navigate to the directory:
      {your_project_path}/tools/langflow/flows

  Select **all `.json` files** in this folder and click **Open**.

Once uploaded, all reference flows will be imported and available for use in your workspace.

#### 1. Run **YoloV8_det Demo** Flow 
-  From the main dashboard, click **`My Projects`**.

- In the project list, choose **`YoloV8_det Demo`**.

- In the flow editor, locate the **`Qualcomm CV Input`** node. Click on it and upload an image — for example, a photo containing a cat or a dog.

- After uploading the image, click the **arrow button (▶️)** on the **`Qualcomm CV Input`** node to confirm the upload.

- Click the **`Playground`** button in the top-right corner of the interface, then click **`Run Flow`**.

#### 2. Run **Image Classification Inceptionv3** Flow 
- From the main dashboard, click **`My Projects`**.

- In the project list, choose **`Image Classification Inceptionv3`**.

- In the flow editor, locate the **`Qualcomm CV Input`** node. Click on it and upload an image — for example, a photo containing a cat or a dog.

- After uploading the image, click the **arrow button (▶️)** on the **`Qualcomm CV Input`** node to confirm the upload.

- Click the **`Playground`** button in the top-right corner of the interface, then click **`Run Flow`**.

> 🕒 **Note:** On first use, the system will automatically download the Inceptionv3 model in the background. This may take approximately **10 minutes** depending on your network speed. Please be patient.


#### 3. Run **Basic Chat Genie** Flow
-  From the main dashboard, click **`My Projects`**.

-  In the project list, choose **`Basic Chat Genie`**.

-  Click the **`Playground`** button in the top-right corner of the interface.

-  Enter your message in the text input box and click **`Send`**.

The flow will invoke a local large language model to generate a response based on your input, enabling interactive chat functionality.
