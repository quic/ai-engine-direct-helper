## Build QAI AppBuilder for WoS device
### Build QAI AppBuilder from source with Visual Studio 2022 on WoS device:<br>
- Install Qualcomm® AI Runtime SDK:
  - https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/#/catalog/item/Qualcomm_AI_Runtime_SDK
- Update the Genie library for using AMD64 Python on WoS device
  - Download [QAIRT_v2.48.40.260702.zip](https://github.com/qualcomm/qai-appbuilder/releases/download/v2.48.40/QAIRT_v2.48.40.260702.zip), unzip it and replace the original files Genie.lib, Genie.dll in your Qualcomm® AI Runtime SDK install path (for example C:\Qualcomm\AIStack\QAIRT\2.48.40.260702\lib\arm64x-windows-msvc\).
  
- Install Visual Studio 2022: 
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-history#release-dates-and-build-numbers<br>
- Install x64 version [Python-3.12.8](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.8/python-3.12.8-amd64.exe) or install arm64 version [Python-3.12.6](https://github.com/qualcomm/qai-appbuilder/blob/main/docs/python_arm64.md) if your app is running on arm64.

- Use the commands below to install Python dependency: 
```
pip install wheel==0.45.1 setuptools==80.9.0 pybind11==2.13.6 build==1.4.0
```
- Clone this repository to local: 
```
git clone https://github.com/qualcomm/qai-appbuilder.git --recursive
```
- If you have cloned it before, you can update the code by the following command:
```
cd qai-appbuilder
git pull --recurse-submodules
```
- Set environment 'QNN_SDK_ROOT' to the Qualcomm® AI Runtime SDK path which you're using. E.g.:
```
Set QNN_SDK_ROOT=C:\Qualcomm\AIStack\QAIRT\2.48.40.260702\
```
- Use the commands below to build and install Python extension(*.whl): <br>
*Note: Please get the corresponding "Supported Toolchains" and "Hexagon Arch" with your device from [Supported Snapdragon devices](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-63442-10/QNN_general_overview.html#supported-snapdragon-devices). <br>

```
cd qai-appbuilder
*Note: Make sure to build in the regular Windows Command Prompt — not in the 'ARM64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022' and not in the 'Power Shell' window.* <br>
     set QNN_SDK_ROOT=C:/Qualcomm/AIStack/QAIRT/2.48.40.260702/
     python -m build -w

# Install the extension:
pip install --force-reinstall dist\qai_appbuilder-2.48.40-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl
```

## Build QAI AppBuilder for Linux
**Clone the repository with submodules:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qualcomm/qai-appbuilder.git --recursive
cd qai-appbuilder
```

### Download QNN SDK

Download the [Qualcomm® AI Runtime (QAIRT) SDK](https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/#/catalog/item/Qualcomm_AI_Runtime_SDK) on your device. This SDK includes the required QNN runtime libraries for AI model execution.

**Download Link of QAIRT v2.40.0.251030:** https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/api/download/software/sdks/Qualcomm_AI_Runtime_Community/All/2.40.0.251030/v2.40.0.251030.zip.

```bash
# Download QAIRT SDK package 
wget https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/api/download/software/sdks/Qualcomm_AI_Runtime_Community/All/2.40.0.251030/v2.40.0.251030.zip

# Extract the runtime libraries
unzip v2.40.0.251030.zip

# Verify extraction
ls v2.40.0.251030/
```

### Set Environment Variables

Configure the required environment variables on your device. Replace `<path_to_v2.40.0.251030>` with the actual path to your extracted QNN SDK directory.

**Common variables for both platforms:**

```bash
export QNN_SDK_ROOT=<path_to_v2.40.0.251030>
export QAI_TOOLCHAINS=aarch64-oe-linux-gcc11.2
```

### Build with direct TFLite support (Linux ARM64 QNN or Windows CPU)

TFLite support is disabled by default. Linux ARM64 uses the matching QAIRT QNN delegate; Windows uses the TFLite CPU interpreter without QNN dependencies. Both paths require a redistributable TFLite C API SDK.

```bash
export QNN_SDK_ROOT=<path-to-qairt>
export TFLITE_ROOT=<path-to-tflite-sdk>
export QAI_TOOLCHAINS=aarch64-oe-linux-gcc11.2
export APPBUILDER_ENABLE_TFLITE=ON
python -m build -w
```

`TFLITE_ROOT` must contain `include/tensorflow/lite/c/c_api.h` and a C API library under `lib/` named `libtensorflowlite_c.so` or `libtflite_c.so`. The QNN SDK must contain `include/QNN/TFLiteDelegate/QnnTFLiteDelegate.h` and `lib/aarch64-oe-linux-gcc11.2/libQnnTFLiteDelegate.so`. The resulting wheel places these direct runtime libraries under `qai_appbuilder/libs/`; inspect them with:

```bash
unzip -l dist/qai_appbuilder-*.whl | grep -E 'tensorflowlite|tflite|QnnTFLiteDelegate'
```

The Windows CPU build uses a separate feature gate:

```powershell
$env:TFLITE_ROOT = "C:/path/to/tflite-sdk"
$env:APPBUILDER_ENABLE_TFLITE_CPU = "ON"
python -m build -w
```

The Windows SDK must provide `include/tensorflow/lite/c/c_api.h`, a `tensorflowlite_c.lib` or `tflite_c.lib` import library under `lib/`, and the matching `tensorflowlite_c.dll` or `tflite_c.dll` under `bin/` or `lib/`. The wheel contains the CPU runtime DLL under `qai_appbuilder/libs/` and does not package `libQnnTFLiteDelegate.so`. `APPBUILDER_ENABLE_TFLITE` and `APPBUILDER_ENABLE_TFLITE_CPU` are mutually exclusive. Do not enable either option unless the runtime artifacts are licensed for redistribution.

#### Direct TFLite runtime limitations

Direct `.tflite` contexts expose a single interpreter graph. Pass only `graphIndex=0` (or omit it) to `QNNContext.Inference()` and metadata getters such as `getInputShapes()`; non-zero graph indices raise an error and multi-graph selection is not supported for `.tflite` models.

`getProfilingEvent()` returns `0` for direct `.tflite` contexts because this path does not expose QNN profiling events. Do not interpret `0` as a measured profiling result.

### Build with direct ExecuTorch support (Linux and Android arm64)

ExecuTorch support is disabled by default and consumes a prebuilt ExecuTorch C++ SDK selected with `EXECUTORCH_ROOT`. The SDK must match the target platform: use a Linux SDK for Linux builds and an Android arm64-v8a SDK for Android NDK builds. Static single-method `.pte` programs with tensor-only `forward` inputs and outputs are supported.

```bash
export EXECUTORCH_ROOT=<path-to-executorch-sdk>
export APPBUILDER_ENABLE_EXECUTORCH=ON
# Optional Qualcomm backend. The .pte must have been lowered for QNN.
export QNN_SDK_ROOT=<path-to-qairt>
export APPBUILDER_ENABLE_EXECUTORCH_QNN=ON
python -m build -w
```

`EXECUTORCH_ROOT` must contain `extension/module/module.h`, `extension/tensor/tensor_ptr.h`, the `extension_module` and `executorch` runtime libraries. An XNNPACK backend library (`executorch_backend_xnnpack` or `xnnpack_backend`) is linked when the SDK provides one; CPU-only builds do not require it. QNN builds additionally require `backends/qualcomm/runtime/QnnExecuTorch.h`, `QNN_SDK_ROOT`, and the ExecuTorch Qualcomm backend library. Runtime shared libraries are copied under `qai_appbuilder/libs/` when present. Do not redistribute ExecuTorch, XNNPACK, QNN, or QAIRT artifacts unless their licenses permit it.

For Android, pass the Android SDK root to `make/Android.mk` and keep `.pte` assets uncompressed when they are memory mapped:

```bash
ndk-build EXECUTORCH_ROOT=<android-arm64-executorch-sdk> \
    EXECUTORCH_ENABLE_XNNPACK=1 EXECUTORCH_ENABLE_QNN=1 APP_ABI=arm64-v8a
```

```kotlin
androidResources {
    noCompress.add("pte")
}
```

Both CPU/XNNPACK and Qualcomm programs report their provider mode through `QNNContext.getProviderMode()`. Performance profiles, asynchronous execution, QNN-only device options, dynamic tensor dimensions, and non-`forward` methods are rejected for `.pte` models in this initial integration.

### Install Python Dependencies

Upgrade build tooling and install required Python packages:

```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cmake build-essential python3.12-dev

# Install core Python packages
pip install wheel==0.45.1 setuptools==80.9.0 pybind11==2.13.6 build==1.4.0
```

### Build QAI AppBuilder Python and C/C++ Libraries

Build the QAI AppBuilder libraries from the project root directory.
```bash
python -m build -w
```

> **Note:** The build process may take several minutes. The output wheel file will be created in the `dist/` directory.

### Install QAI AppBuilder Wheel Package

Install the built wheel package:

```bash
python -m pip install dist/qai_appbuilder-*.whl
```

> **Note:** The version number may vary based on your QNN SDK version.

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
python -c "import qai_appbuilder; print('QAI AppBuilder installed successfully')"
```

> **Note:** QAI AppBuilder provides multiple examples of AI applications developed using Python, covering scenarios such as image super-resolution, object detection, and image classification. Refer to (samples/linux/README.md)

## Build QAI AppBuilder for android

### Download QAI AppBuilder source codes:
Run below command in Windows terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/qualcomm/qai-appbuilder.git --recursive
```

### Set PATH and run make.exe to build QAI AppBuilder
• Download [android ndk](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r26d-windows.zip).<br>
• Run following commands in Windows terminal:
```
cd qai-appbuilder
Set QNN_SDK_ROOT=C:\Qualcomm\AIStack\QAIRT\{Qualcomm® AI Runtime SDK version}\
Set NDK_ROOT={your ndk root directory}
set PATH=%PATH%;%NDK_ROOT%\toolchains\llvm\prebuilt\windows-x86_64\bin
Set ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=%NDK_ROOT%
 
"%NDK_ROOT%\prebuilt\windows-x86_64\bin\make.exe" android
```
• Then you will see the generated file qai-appbuilder\libs\arm64-v8a\libappbuilder.so.

### Debug issues about AppBuilder
• Sometimes we will meet error which is related with libAppBuilder.so, for example below abnormal info when execute SuperResolution app on Snapdragon® 8 Elite mobile device. 
```
/real_esrgan_x4plus/real_esrgan_x4plus.bin" "/sdcard/AIModels/SuperResolution/real_esrgan_x4plus/input.jpg" "/sdcard/AIModels/SuperResolution/real_esrgan_x4plus/output.jpg"
          <
     0.3ms [ ERROR ] Unable to find a valid interface.
     0.4ms [ ERROR ] Error initializing QNN Function Pointers
```

• To check above errors info about AppBuilder further, we can 'Compile All Sources' in android studio to generate the bin file of superresolution after modify its CMakeLists.txt file as below,  
```
- add_library(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} SHARED native-lib.cpp)
+ # add_library(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} SHARED native-lib.cpp)

- # add_executable(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} native-lib.cpp) # Build command line executable binary for debugging.
+ add_executable(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} native-lib.cpp) # Build command line executable binary for debugging.
```

• Copy SuperResolution bin file and other below 9 .so files from SuperResolution\app\build\intermediates\cxx\Debug\63644d4r\obj\arm64-v8a and C:\Qualcomm\AIStack\QAIRT\{Qualcomm® AI Runtime SDK version}\lib\ to /data/local/tmp/debug of android device.
```
libappbuilder.so
libc++_shared.so
libopencv_java4.so
libQnnHtp.so
libQnnHtpNetRunExtensions.so
libQnnHtpPrepare.so
libQnnHtpV79Skel.so
libQnnHtpV79Stub.so
libQnnSystem.so
```

• Then run below 5 shell commands in android device to debug:
```
cd  /data/local/tmp/debug
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/local/tmp/debug
export PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PATH
chmod +x ./superresolution
./superresolution "/data/local/tmp/debug" "/sdcard/AIModels/SuperResolution/real_esrgan_x4plus/real_esrgan_x4plus.bin" "/sdcard/AIModels/SuperResolution/real_esrgan_x4plus/input.jpg" "/sdcard/AIModels/SuperResolution/real_esrgan_x4plus/output.jpg"
```

• Root cause<br>
Above error info is due to version incompatible between libappbuilder.so and QAIRT sdk version. 
It is resolved by recompile libappbuilder.so after set correct QNN_SDK_ROOT.
