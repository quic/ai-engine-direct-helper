## QAI AppBuilder

**QAI AppBuilder** (the "Quick AI Application Builder", this repository) is an open-source,
**on-device AI application platform** built on top of the
[Qualcomm® AI Runtime SDK](https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/#/catalog/item/Qualcomm_AI_Runtime_SDK).
Just describe the app you want in plain language — the AI Agent turns it into a complete,
runnable application on the Snapdragon NPU, with **no coding required**.

### From an idea to a running app — in one conversation

At the center of QAI AppBuilder is the **App Builder**: tell the Agent what you want to build
("*a screenshot OCR tool*", "*a voice-memo transcriber*", "*a real-time speech translator*")
and it assembles a complete, self-contained local application for you — picking the right
models, wiring up the pipeline, and generating the UI. The default output is a lightweight
local web app; with a custom prompt the Agent can produce a CLI tool, a desktop utility, or a
batch script just as easily.

To do this, the Agent draws on **on-device Model Packs** (Whisper, Zipformer-ZH, MeloTTS,
PP-OCR and more) and, whenever it needs a model that isn't packaged yet, resolves it
automatically — downloading a pre-built model straight from
[Qualcomm AI Hub](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/compute/models) when one exists, or converting
your own PyTorch / ONNX model (export → quantization → context-binary generation → accuracy
validation via QAIRT SDK) when it doesn't. Either way, you never leave the conversation, and
every model ends up running on the same on-device NPU engine (`QNNContext` via
`qai-appbuilder`).

### Why it matters

- **Minutes, not days** — get a working local AI app without hand-writing a UI or wiring up
  model I/O yourself.
- **Truly on-device** — every model runs on the Snapdragon NPU; your data never leaves the
  machine. No internet connection is needed at inference time.
- **Private by design** — a natural fit for privacy-sensitive scenarios (corporate documents,
  medical images, personal recordings), backed by a built-in security module that gates every
  file, command, and tool the Agent touches.
- **Extensible** — the Agent is driven by hot-reloadable **Skills** and **Model Packs**; add a
  new self-contained module and the Agent picks it up automatically.

### Get Started with QAI AppBuilder

> **QAI AppBuilder** is the natural-language Agent platform for the App Builder,
> Model Builder, and AI Hub Model Run capabilities described above all live here. Grab the
> pre-built package below and you'll have a running, on-device AI app builder in **two commands**.

</div>

<br>

**Just want to use it? Two steps:**

> **Platform:** Windows on Snapdragon (ARM64). No admin rights needed — `Setup.bat` automatically
> downloads Python, Node.js, QAIRT SDK, and model weights for you.

1. **Download & unzip**
   [`qaiappbuilder.zip`](https://github.com/qualcomm/qai-appbuilder/releases/download/v3.0.0/qaiappbuilder.zip),
   then open `cmd.exe` in the extracted folder.

2. **Run two commands** — the first installs the environment (one-time), the second launches the
   WebUI and opens your browser:

```cmd
Setup.bat
Start.bat
```

On Linux (Ubuntu aarch64/x86_64), unzip/clone the project instead and run the equivalent shell
scripts from a terminal:

```bash
bash setup.sh
bash start.sh
```

Your browser opens the QAI AppBuilder WebUI — start chatting to build an app, convert a model,
or run one straight from AI Hub.

**Want to read or modify the code?** The complete QAI AppBuilder project lives at
[`tools/qaiappbuilder`](https://github.com/qualcomm/qai-appbuilder/tree/main/tools/qaiappbuilder).
Clone the repo, then run `Setup.bat` → `Build.bat` → `Start.bat` to launch from source.

## ☁️ Connect Cloud AI Models

### About Route1

**Route1** is the built-in default cloud provider — no need to apply for your own API key, works out of the box, and is a convenient way to quickly try out the system's features. **Route1 allocates a fixed token quota per Qualcomm account**: once the quota is exhausted, this provider becomes unavailable, and you can switch to a third-party cloud model you configure yourself (see the setup steps below). For long-term or heavy usage, we recommend connecting your own cloud model provider.

> **QAI AppBuilder can connect to any OpenAI-compatible third-party cloud AI model** (e.g. OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, etc.), for use in model conversion and to power the [LLM Multi-Model Agent Pipeline](#llm-multi-model-agent-pipeline) that autonomously orchestrates your local App Builder Packs.

### Setup Steps

1. **Open Settings** — click **Settings** in the left-hand sidebar menu.
2. **Go to the Cloud Models tab** — click **Cloud Models** at the top of the Settings page.
3. **Add a model** — click **Add Model** and fill in the popup form:
   - **Base URL**: the OpenAI-compatible API endpoint provided by the third-party service
   - **API Key**: your key (stored encrypted via the OS keyring once saved — never written in plaintext)
   - **Model Name**: the model identifier provided by the service (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `deepseek-chat`, `qwen-plus`, etc.)
4. **Save** — the change takes effect immediately, no restart required. The newly added cloud model appears in the model selector in the chat UI.

> You can repeat these steps to add multiple third-party cloud model providers and switch between them freely in the chat UI. If your network requires a proxy to reach the cloud API, configure an outbound proxy under **Settings → App Config** (network section) — see [Network Proxy](#network-proxy).

## QAI Skills

QAI AppBuilder ships two built-in AI Agent Skills that together cover the full on-device model lifecycle — from sourcing a model all the way to running inference on the Snapdragon NPU.

### Skill 1 — AI Hub Model Run

> **Use this skill when the model you need already exists on [Qualcomm AI Hub](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/compute/models).**

The **AI Hub Model Run** skill downloads pre-exported QNN models directly from AI Hub and runs them on the Snapdragon NPU via `qai_appbuilder` (`QNNContext`) — no conversion, no Visual Studio, no QAIRT SDK required.

| What it does | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Supported formats** | `QNN_CONTEXT_BINARY` (`.bin`), `QNN_DLC` (`.dlc`), `ONNX` (CPU baseline only), `VOICE_AI`, `TFLITE` |
| **Inference engine** | Always `qai_appbuilder.QNNContext` loading `.bin` / `.dlc` on the NPU/HTP; `onnxruntime` is used only for optional CPU accuracy comparison |
| **Target devices** | Snapdragon X Elite, Snapdragon X2 Elite, Snapdragon X Plus 8-Core |
| **Typical workflow** | Detect chipset → fetch download link from AI Hub → `curl` download → extract ZIP → run inference script |
| **No conversion needed** | Pre-compiled `.bin` / `.dlc` packages load directly — first-run graph compilation takes 5–60 s, subsequent runs are fast |
| **CPU baseline** | Optionally compare NPU output against `onnxruntime` CPU baseline (cosine similarity > 0.999 for float models) |

**Example trigger prompts:**
```
"Download Inception V3 from AI Hub and run inference on my photo"
"Run YOLOv8 object detection on this image using the NPU"
"Use the pre-built Whisper model to transcribe my audio file"
```

---

### Skill 2 — Model Builder

> **Use this skill when you have a custom PyTorch or ONNX model that is NOT available on AI Hub.**

The **Model Builder** skill automates the full QNN conversion pipeline for custom models — from ONNX export all the way to a validated `.bin` context binary running on the Snapdragon NPU.

| What it does | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Input formats** | PyTorch (`.pt` / `.pth`) → ONNX export, or existing ONNX (`.onnx`) |
| **Output formats** | QNN context binary (`.bin`), QNN model library (`.dll`), SNPE DLC (`.dlc`) |
| **Supported precisions** | FP16, FP32, W8A16, W8A8, W8A8B8, W4A16, W4A8 |
| **Auto pipeline** | Export → ONNX inspection → operator patching → QNN conversion → context binary generation → inference → accuracy validation vs. ONNX CPU baseline |
| **Operator patching** | Automatically detects and patches unsupported operators (Einsum, GridSample, ScatterND, Mod, Floor…) with QNN-compatible equivalents |
| **Accuracy validation** | Computes cosine similarity between QNN output and ONNX CPU baseline; threshold ≥ 0.99 (FP16/FP32) or ≥ 0.95 (INT8/quantized) |
| **Auto-generated inference code** | Saves a standalone `infer_<model>.py` and `inference_manifest.json` after successful validation — ready for App Builder Pack export |
| **Requires** | QAIRT SDK 2.45+, Visual Studio 2022 Community, Python x64 3.10 (all auto-installed by `Setup.bat`) |
| **Scope** | Best suited for small-to-medium models (recommended < 2 GB); LLM conversion is not yet supported |

**Example trigger prompts:**
```
"Convert my ResNet ONNX model to QNN FP16 and validate the accuracy"
"Convert my custom YOLOv8 model to W8A8 with calibration data and compare against the original"
"Export my PyTorch model to QNN, run inference, and generate an App Builder pack"
```

## WebUI AI Application

We have developed several [WebUI AI applications](samples/webui/) based on QAI AppBuilder, allowing you to experience them quickly.
All these applications run on a local PC, requiring *no internet connection* and are *completely free*.
You can run WebUI AI applications through the batch file [4.Start_WebUI.bat](tools/launcher/4.Start_WebUI.bat).

> **Note:** Before trying other functions, we suggest that you try these WebUI AI applications first.

| App | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| ImageRepairApp | An image restoration tool designed to repair old or damaged photographs. |
| StableDiffusionApp | A text-to-image generation tool that creates images based on user input. |
| GenieWebUI | A large language model (LLM) interface that enables interactive conversations. |

---

## OpenAI Compatible API Service (GenieAPIService)

Considering that the current mainstream method for invoking LLMs is based on OpenAI-compatible APIs, we have implemented such interfaces in both C++ and Python. This allows application developers to interact with the local large language model running on NPU in a familiar way.

Many third-party applications that support the OpenAI API can seamlessly switch to the local NPU-based model by simply changing the API endpoint.

We have also implemented client sample code for GenieAPIService in both C++ and Python for developer reference.
